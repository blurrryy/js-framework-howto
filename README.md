# DanielJS - A basic study on how to start your own JavaScript framework

If you are curious how a JavaScript framework like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) works behind the scenes, here is my personal approach to built my own framework.

This propably won't be continued. I just wanted this to be like a prove of concept.

This just has two functions implemented.

1. Replace the {{placeholders}} with an actual string which is provided in the initial Object
2. Create a simple for-loop that loops through an Array and replaces the basic element in the template

I've tried to comment my code as much as possible.
