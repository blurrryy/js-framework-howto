# DanielJS - A basic study on how to start your own JavaScript framework

If you are curious how a JavaScript framework like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) works behind the scenes, here is my personal approach to built my own framework.

This propably won't be continued. I just wanted this to be like a proof of concept.

This just has two functions implemented.

1. Replace the {{placeholders}} with an actual string which is provided in the initial Object
2. Create a simple for-loop that loops through an Array and replaces the basic element in the template
3. Show how it works to overload the setter of a given variable to trigger rerender on change
4. Implement an async API-Call to JSON-Placeholder to thow that it actually works!

I've tried to comment my code as much as possible.

I isn't hard to find bugs if you try hard enough. As I already told you: This is just some kind of POC.
